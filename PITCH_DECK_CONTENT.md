## Slide 2: The Hook

Traditional Marketing vs. DropLab

Creating 10,000 Personalized Marketing Images:

OLD WAY (gpt-image-1)
⏱️ Time: 16-33 hours
💰 Cost: $2,630
📊 Attribution: None
☎️ After-hours: Lost calls

NEW WAY (DropLab)
⏱️ Time: 50 minutes (30x faster)
💰 Cost: $390 (85% cheaper)
📊 Attribution: Perfect (QR → Revenue)
☎️ After-hours: AI agent (24/7)

Same quality. Better tracking. Fraction of the cost.
```

### Speaker Notes
- "Let me start with a specific example that shows why this matters."
- "A 50-location hearing aid company running a campaign to 10,000 people."
- "The old way: 33 hours, $2,630, no idea what works."
- "Our way: 50 minutes, $390, perfect attribution. And they get a 24/7 AI call center included."
- "This isn't incremental improvement - it's 10-30x better."

## Slide 3: The Problem

### Visual
```
[Icon grid showing 4 pain points with $ and clock symbols]
```

### Content
```
Marketing is Broken for Multi-Location Retail

❌ TOO SLOW
60-120 seconds per image
16-33 hours for 10K campaign
Can't iterate quickly

❌ TOO EXPENSIVE
$263 per premium AI image
$2.6M for 10K campaign creative
Agencies charge $50K+/month

❌ NO ATTRIBUTION
"Half my marketing works..."
Can't track DM → digital → revenue
No optimization possible

❌ MISSED REVENUE
60% of calls after 6pm
No 24/7 customer service
Lost opportunities = lost revenue
```

### Speaker Notes
- "These aren't hypothetical problems - they're costing businesses millions every year."
- "Slow: Can't A/B test or iterate when each image takes 2 minutes."
- "Expensive: $263 per image is the current market rate for premium AI generation using OpenAI's gpt-image-1 model."
- "No attribution: Businesses spend $50M on marketing with no idea which campaigns drive revenue."
- "Missed calls: 60% of customer calls happen after hours when nobody answers."
- "This is a massive inefficiency waiting to be fixed."

```

### Speaker Notes
- "DropLab solves all four problems with a complete platform."
- "Speed: We use Google's Gemini Flash AI - the newest model. 3-4 seconds vs 60-120 seconds. Competitors are 12-18 months behind."
- "Cost: $0.039 vs $263. This isn't a pricing strategy - it's a structural advantage from being first on Gemini."
- "Attribution: For the first time, businesses can see: this direct mail campaign generated 143 QR scans, 67 calls, and $147K in revenue."
- "Call center: Included free. Handles bookings, questions, FAQs - 24/7."

## Slide 5: How It Works (Customer Journey)

### Content
```
The Complete Customer Journey

1. CREATE CAMPAIGN (3 min)
   └→ AI generates personalized images in 3-4s
   └→ Unique QR codes for each recipient

2. SEND DIRECT MAIL
   └→ Customer receives personalized postcard

3. CUSTOMER SCANS QR
   └→ Lands on personalized landing page
   └→ Books appointment OR calls AI agent

4. COMPLETE ATTRIBUTION
   └→ Track: Campaign → QR Scan → Page Visit → Conversion → Revenue

5. OPTIMIZE & SCALE
   └→ See what works → Do more of it
   └→ Reuse templates: $0 creative cost
```

### Speaker Notes
- "Let me walk through how a customer experiences this."
- "Step 1: Business creates a campaign in 3 minutes. AI generates images in 3-4 seconds each."
- "Step 2: They mail personalized postcards with unique QR codes."
- "Step 3: Customer scans QR, lands on a personalized landing page."
- "Step 4: Customer books appointment on the page or calls the 24/7 AI agent."
- "Step 5: Business sees complete attribution - which campaign drove which revenue."
- "This loop doesn't exist anywhere else. Nobody connects DM → digital → calls → revenue."

[DropLab in bottom-right corner: Fast + Cheap]
[Competitors scattered in other quadrants]
```

### Content
```
We Compete on Cost, Speed & Attribution

TRADITIONAL AGENCIES (99% of market)
• Manual, slow, expensive
• $10K-50K per campaign, 2-4 weeks
• No technology, no scale

LEGACY SAAS (Mailchimp, Constant Contact)
• Email-only, no DM capability
• $300-2K/month, basic analytics
• Missing: AI, attribution, call center

AI TOOLS (Jasper, Copy.ai)
• Copywriting only, no execution
• $50-500/month, fragmented workflow
• Missing: DM production, tracking, calls

DROPLAB ADVANTAGES
✅ 85% cheaper (Gemini vs old OpenAI)
✅ 30x faster (structural tech advantage)
✅ Complete attribution (only solution with QR → revenue)
✅ 24/7 AI call center (included, not extra)
✅ Template system (network effects)
```

### Speaker Notes
- "Three types of competitors, none have our complete stack."
- "Traditional agencies: 99% of the market is still manual. They're slow, expensive, and can't scale. We're 10x better on every dimension."
- "Legacy SaaS: Mailchimp does email. We do direct mail. Different channel, but even if they added DM, they're years behind on AI and don't have call center."
- "AI Tools: Jasper writes copy. That's it. No execution, no tracking, no calls. They're a feature, we're a platform."
- "Our moat: Nobody else has Gemini cost advantage + complete attribution + call center in one platform. And we're 12-18 months ahead on Gemini while competitors migrate from old models."

## Slide 9: Business Model & Unit Economics

### Visual
```
[Visual calculator/spreadsheet showing customer economics]
```

### Content
```
SaaS + Usage Model with Immediate ROI

PRICING (50-location customer)
• Platform: $200/month per location = $10K/month
• DM Usage: $0.05 per piece (optional)
• AI Calls: $0.10 per call (optional)
• Total: ~$126K/year

CUSTOMER BREAKS EVEN IMMEDIATELY
Before DropLab:
• 10 campaigns/year × 10K DMs × $263/image
• = $26.3M annual creative cost
• + Agency fees, printing: ~$35M total

With DropLab:
• Same campaigns: $0.039/image × 10K × 10
• = $3,900 annual creative cost
• Platform: $120K/year
• Total: ~$150K/year

SAVINGS: $34.85M annually (before any new revenue!)

UNIT ECONOMICS
• Gross Margin: 80%+ (AI APIs are cheap)
• CAC: $5K (2-month sales cycle)
• LTV: $300K+ (3-year retention)
• LTV/CAC: 60x
• Payback: 6 months
```

### Speaker Notes
- "The business model is simple: SaaS subscription + usage-based upsells."
- "A 50-location customer pays $10K/month. Sounds expensive until you see the ROI..."
- "Their old cost: $35M/year for marketing creative and agency fees."
- "New cost: $150K/year including our platform."
- "They save $34.85M annually BEFORE seeing any new revenue from better marketing."
- "This is why the sales motion works - customers break even immediately just on cost savings. Any new revenue is pure upside."
- "Unit economics are incredible: 60x LTV/CAC, 6-month payback, 80%+ gross margins."
- "This is a highly profitable, scalable business."

## Slide 10: Go-To-Market

### Visual
```
[Funnel diagram showing 3 phases]
[Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3]
```

### Content
```
Focused Beachhead → Expand

PHASE 1 (Months 0-12): Hearing Aid Centers
• Target: 15,000 locations in US
• Why: $10K-20K sales, senior demographic, direct mail works
• Goal: 50 customers, $500K ARR

PHASE 2 (Months 12-24): Dental/Medical
• Target: 200K+ dental practices, 50K med spas
• Why: Similar economics, proven playbook
• Goal: 200 customers, $2M ARR

PHASE 3 (Months 24-36): Horizontal Expansion
• Target: Any multi-location retail
• Why: Platform generalizes
• Goal: 500+ customers, $10M+ ARR

SALES MOTION
• Inside sales (SDR + AE)
• 2-month sales cycle
• Land: 1-5 locations ($200-1K/month)
• Expand: Add locations, usage upsells
• Retain: 90%+ NRR (saves money = sticky)
```

### Speaker Notes
- "We're not trying to be everything to everyone. Focused beachhead strategy."
- "Phase 1: Hearing aids. Perfect fit - seniors prefer direct mail, high-ticket sales mean high marketing spend, 15,000 locations to target."
- "50 customers in year 1 proves the model. $500K ARR gets us to Series A."
- "Phase 2: Expand to dental, med spas. Same playbook, larger market."
- "Phase 3: Horizontal expansion. Once we own hearing aids, the platform works for any multi-location retail."
- "Sales motion: Inside sales, 2-month cycle. Land small, expand over time."
- "Retention is high because they save money every month. Churn kills SaaS - our customers can't afford to churn."
